# Quantum Principal Component Analysis
Quantum principal component analysis (qPCA) is the quantum version of principal component analysis (PCA). Principal component analysis (PCA), a dimension reduction method, is a very important algorithm for signal processing and machine learning. The qPCA outputs all eigenvalues and then obtains the top-r eigenvalues by sampling. 
# Objective
This exact quantum principal component analysis algorithm, which screens the data components through the threshold, rather than output all components of data.
# Description
We implemented our qPCA algorithm on the IBM quantum computing platform: IBM Quantum Experience.
